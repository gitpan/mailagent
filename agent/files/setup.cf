# Types of various configuration parameters. A lowercase f/d indicates an
# optional file/directory, or one that will be created on demand. An uppercase
# F/D means a mandatory file/directory that should exist.

# When using 'mailagent -I', a mandatory directory will be created, while a
# mandatory file will be copied from a template lying in the privlib directory
# when specified; otherwise, it is created with a null size.
